# Vaccine Availability Whatsapp Bot
 
On 1 May, the central government started the third leg of its inoculation drive against COVID-19, in which all citizens over the age of 18 can register themselves to get vaccinated. However, with a huge population of the country belonging to this age bracket, this leg of the vaccination drive isn't going as smoothly as one would've hoped. Five days into the drive, people are still struggling to secure a slot for their first dose of the vaccine. In some cities, the situation is much worse than in others.

However, bots are proving to be an effective solution to this problem.

They sort out information such as the next available slot or the nearest vaccination centre. These services notify users via text, messengers or email.

Notably, these bots merely provide information on availability of a slot or a vaccination centre near you, but bookings will still have to be manually done by a user via the CoWIN portal.


The COVID-19 Vaccine Availability Bot will let you know whether vaccine is available in your district currently. To know the details , you have to send join park-continent to ðŸ“± "+1 415-523-8886" on WhatsApp. 
Once you get connected to Sandbox, then type "Hi" Or "Hello" to initiate the chat. Then type District PIN number to know the information.
